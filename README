Included in this bundle is a known good target of qextserialport. The
qextserialport library is bundled to ensure correct compilation and a
known feature set that has been tested.  qextserialport is licensed under
the MIT license by its original author(s), and Dynamic Perception makes
no claim to changes or copyright, except wherein changes have been made to
QT project files to ensure proper compilation.

This bundle is created inside of a top-level directory named 'libs', to add 
this library to your Qt project, copy the entire libs directory into your project, and
ensure that your top-level project file has the following contents:

TEMPLATE = subdirs
SUBDIRS += libs

Then, after having created a sub-directory for your actual project code, add
 the following to the .pro file in that subdirectory:

CONFIG += ordered

INCLUDEPATH  += ../libs/qextserialport/src/ \
		../libs/OpenMoCo \
                ../libs/OpenMoCo/OpenMoCo \
                .

        LIBS += -L../libs/OpenMoCo/debug
    }
    CONFIG(release, debug|release) {
        LIBS += -L../libs/OpenMoCo/release
    }

    LIBS += -L../libs/qextserialport/src/build
}
