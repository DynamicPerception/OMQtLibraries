OpenMoCo MoCoBus Libraries for Qt
=================================

The OpenMoCo Qt Libraries provide all of the needed tools to create your own software to control nanoMoCo devices and any other MoCoBus-enabled device using the Qt framework.  These libraries contain all of the tools needed to control any number of devices smartly, and manage buses of devices asynchronously in applications using the Observer pattern. The OpenMoCo Qt Libraries are released under the LGPLv3 license, and can be included in proprietary applications.

For those wishing to create their own software to control the nanoMoCo devices, they should first consult the documentation for the OMAxis and OMNetwork classes.

For those wishing to create their own Qt libraries to control their custom-design devices operating on MoCoBus, they should first consult the documentation for the OMDevice class.
